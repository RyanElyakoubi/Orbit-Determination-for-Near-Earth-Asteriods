# Orbit-Determination-for-Near-Earth-Asteriods
Created orbit determination software that calculates the asteriod's current position, it's velocity vectors, and solves for the asteroids six orbital elements which characterize the asteroid's orbital ellipse. Most importantly, it solves for it's future trajectory.
